The source for Broken Code
This includes the basic code for the Broken Code project, the project consists of 60 versions of this.
It was not possible to include all 60 versions for obvious reasons; please assume that all seperate codes follow this basic format but have varying degrees of variations.
This code was taken from a Creative Commons liscense on openprocessing.com and expanded to create variations and then further manipulated through Processing and Premiere Pro.
